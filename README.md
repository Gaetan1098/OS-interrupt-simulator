# Operating System Interrupt Simulator

This project simulates an interrupt-driven CPU, focusing on how different types of work (CPU execution, I/O, system calls, and overhead) are handled in an operating system environment. It has been enhanced to include Process Control Block (PCB) Scheduling and Memory Management, allowing the simulation of process scheduling and memory allocation in addition to interrupt handling. The simulator parses execution logs, analyzes the time spent on each type of work, and calculates ratios and performance metrics. Developed in C, this project provides a comprehensive view of how interrupts, processes, and memory management impact overall system performance.

## Overview
The interrupt simulator models how a CPU interacts with interrupts, system calls, and I/O events during execution. The project includes:
1. **Interrupt Handling Simulation** - Written in C, it processes trace files that describe a sequence of CPU instructions, system calls, and I/O events. It simulates process creation, execution, and memory management, incorporating Process Control Block (PCB) Scheduling and Fixed Partition Memory Allocation.
2. **Log Analysis** - A Python script analyzes the simulator’s execution logs to calculate CPU, I/O, and overhead ratios. The results are then exported to an Excel sheet for performance analysis.
3. **Automation** - Shell scripts are used to compile and run the simulator with different trace files, facilitating easy testing, simulation, and data generation. The simulation also supports dynamic memory management during process execution.

## Key Components

### 1. **interrupts.c & interrupts.h**
These files form the core of the simulator:
- **`interrupts.c`** handles the interrupt simulation by parsing a trace file, which lists the events (e.g., CPU execution, system calls, I/O events). The simulator tracks the time spent on each event type.
- **`interrupts.h`** contains function declarations and constants used in the simulator.

### 2. **execution_analyzer.py**
This Python script processes the log generated by the interrupt simulator:
- **Log Parsing**: Extracts time, duration, and action from the log file (e.g., `execution1.txt`).
- **Classification**: Categorizes each action as CPU work, I/O work, or overhead.
- **Analysis**: Computes total time spent in CPU work, I/O work, and overhead, then calculates the ratio for each.
- **Output**: Exports the results into an Excel file (e.g., `execution1_summary.xlsx`).

### 3. **Trace Files (trace1.txt)**  
Trace files provide the input for the simulator, listing sequences of CPU, system calls, and I/O events, along with their durations.

### 4. **Shell Scripts (test1.sh)**
These scripts automate the process of compiling and running the simulator with a specific trace file.

## Techniques Used

- **Interrupt Handling in C**: Demonstrates handling of interrupts, system calls, and I/O events.
- **File Parsing in Python**: Python’s regular expressions are used to parse execution logs and extract relevant details.
- **Excel File Generation**: `pandas` and `openpyxl` are used to generate detailed performance reports in Excel format.
- **Shell Scripting**: Automates the process of compiling and running the simulator for different trace files.

## How to Run

### Running the Interrupt Simulator

1. **Compile the Simulator**:
   Use the provided `test1.sh` to compile and run the simulator with the sample trace file:
   ```bash
   bash test1.sh
   ```
   This will produce an execution log (e.g., `execution1.txt`), showing a sequence of CPU operations, system calls, and I/O interactions.

2. **Analyzing the Execution Log**:
   Run the Python analysis script to generate a report:
   ```bash
   python execution_analyzer.py execution1.txt execution1_summary.xlsx
   ```

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Systems Programming**: Simulated interrupt handling in C.
- **File I/O and Parsing**: Handled trace and log files in both C and Python.
- **Data Analysis**: Generated performance reports using Python libraries.
- **Automation with Shell Scripting**: Automated compilation and execution.

## Debugging Techniques

1. **Print Statements**: Traced the flow of the program by printing key variables like time and action.
2. **Regex Debugging**: Printed lines before and after regex matching to adjust patterns for better parsing.
3. **Conditional Debugging**: Verified specific program branches, such as event categorization, with conditionals.
4. **Zero-Division Handling**: Ensured edge cases like zero `total_time` were handled gracefully to avoid errors.
5. **Manual Testing**: Tested different trace files to ensure correct parsing and categorization of log data.
6. **Cross-Referencing Outputs**: Verified simulator and analysis script outputs were consistent with input trace files.
